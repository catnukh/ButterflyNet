# ü¶ã ButterflyNet ü¶ã
## About project
This project is focused on classifying different spesies of butterflies using deep learning technics. The classification will be performed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented with the PyTorch library.
## How to use
1Ô∏è‚É£ Intall libraries
All required libraries and their versions are listed in the ```requirements.txt``` file. To install them, run:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2Ô∏è‚É£ Download dataset
Since the dataset is too large to be stored on GitHub, you can download it manually from Kaggle:
