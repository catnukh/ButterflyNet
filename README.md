# ðŸ¦‹ ButterflyNet ðŸ¦‹
## About project
This project is focused on classifying different spesies of butterflies using deep learning technics. The classification will be performed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented with the PyTorch library. And final pretreined model ResNet18.
## How to use
### Intall libraries

Here is the list of libraries needed:
* PyTorch
* scikit-learn
* Pandas
* PIL
* Optuna
* MLflow
* tqdm
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* zipfile

## Download dataset
Since the dataset is too large to be stored on GitHub, you can download it manually from Kaggle:
[Page with dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phucthaiv02/butterfly-image-classification/data)

You need to click here:
